### Important notes

- Navlinks: These two links (home and planning) used as a button element instead of anchor element because i didnt use any paths in this app
- The Logo: This logo wasn't made by me and found it on [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/logo_187879?term=logo&page=2&position=95&origin=search&related_id=187879)
- Layout of Todo card: I didnt design the layout from scratch and used an exist one, [Todo Card Design](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bc/a5/54/bca55433cd1d75268d3378107cb1226c.jpg) i took the stars off because i had no use for them in this app.
